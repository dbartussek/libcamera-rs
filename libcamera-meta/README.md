# libcamera-meta

Helper library to generate control and property definitions from libcamera YAMLs.



The control and property definitions are listed in `include/libcamera/meson.build` in libcamera. As of writing, controls are split into three files ('draft', 'core' and 'rpi'), properties into two ('draft' and 'core').
